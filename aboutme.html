      <h1><a class="header">Hi! I'm Austin.</a></h1>
      <p>
        I'm a Santa Clara University student currently pursuing a computer science major 
        and a mathematics minor.
        <br> <br>
        As a passionate and detail-oriented individual with hands-on experience in data 
        analysis, process automation, and UI/UX, I thrive in leveraging technology to 
        improve efficiency, communication, and management capabilities. I have a strong 
        background in Python, C/C++, Java, HTML/CSS/JS, ML, and Power Suite/Platform, 
        allowing me to deliver optimal, systematic, and streamlined solutions.
        <br> <br>
        If I'm not busy studying, coding, or grinding LeetCode problems, you can find me 
        playing sports, practicing piano, or spamming GamePigeon games to my friends.
        <br> <br>
        Feel free to reach out if you think you can beat me in Word Hunt! (you can't)
