      <h1><a class="header">Hi! I'm Austin.</a></h1>
      <p>
        I'm a Santa Clara University student currently pursuing a computer science major 
        and a mathematics minor, with an emphasis on data science. Check out my other
        <a id="hyplink" href="experience.html">experiences</a> and <a id="hyplink" href="projects.html">projects</a>
        as well!
        <br> <br>
        If I'm not busy studying, coding, or sleeping, you can find me playing sports, 
        practicing piano, or at the gym with my friends. Or manipulating my friends in 
        Catan, or biking, or doing chess puzzles, or taking long walks on the beach, or 
        spamming my friends with GamePigeon games...
        <br> <br>
        Feel free to reach out if you think you can beat me in Word Hunt! (you can't)
